# Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
#### Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree, Project 4. Natural Language Process (Evaluate a news article).

The purpose of this project is building a web tool allowing users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs, etc. found on any given website. Utilizing the Aylien API to build a simple web interface which interacts with their NLP system, this tool returns relevant information about the article, e.g., whether the content is subjective (opinion) and/or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in the overall tone.
