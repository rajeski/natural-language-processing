# Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
#### Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree, Project 4. Natural Language Process (Evaluate a news article).

The purpose of this project is building a web tool allowing users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs, etc. found on any given website. Utilizing the Aylien API to build a simple web interface which interacts with their NLP system, this tool returns relevant information about the article, e.g., whether the content is subjective (opinion) and/or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in the overall tone. This sort of data analysis is useful regarding filtering out 'fake' news (which, unfortunately, all too often proliferates on Social Media).

Node and express ae used for the webserver and routing with webpack for the build tool.
